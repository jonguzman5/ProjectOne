### User Stories

This game is for those who are curious and would like to try a new 
genre of music. This game showcases the the most popular Kpop songs of 2016.


### Minimum Viable Product

Dots will fall from top to bottom where they will connect with letters' 
location at the bottom. In order to gain points the user must press
the appropriate key according to the letter displayed and the location of the dot. 
Upon missing the target the user will lose points. 

### Approach Taken

* Create a div for each dot displayed
* Give each dot their own randomized behavior based on time and vertical pixel length
* Hand in hand use of CSS' keyframes and jQuery's setInterval and keydown functions
* Randomize the execution of audio files that are within an array

### Technologies used

* **HTML:** * Used to render game in the browser
* **CSS:** * To apply styling(color, positioning, etc) and animations(keyframes)
* **JavaScript/jQuery:** * Overall functionality, to determine win/lose, manipulating the keyframes, etc.
* **Git: Used to set up repositories as well as site deployment**
* **Google Chrome: ** *Developer tools used for debugging

###Installation Instructions
* Installation not required as this game runs directly on the browser.

### Unsolved Problems
* There are minor bugs with the distance in which the dots are allowed to travel
* The game is always running, even on the landing page

``Note: fixes coming soon``
