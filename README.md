The plan is to develop a game that showcases the most popular KPop
artists in recent months. The functionality of the game will be as follows:
Objects will fall from top to bottom where they must connect with letters
that remain on the bottom. In order to gain points the user must press
the appropriate key on which the object falls upon. Upon missing the 
target the user will lose points. To do this the hand in hand use of 
CSS' keyframes and jquery's setInterval and Keydown methods will be
necesary. 
This game is for those who are curious and would like to try a new 
genre of music.
